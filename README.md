# flood_relief

**An Android App**, designed and developed to help the ***stranded people of the flood and rain*** in **Kerala**, focussing on *seeking help* from the **local support** for finding and rescuing the survivors of the disaster **in all the flood affected district areas**. 

App collects and fetches the **user's geo location, tags it with the message from the user, rates the need and level of support needed
and shares with the local rescue and support crew who are geographically nearer to the stranded ones.**

Done with the aim to help ones in danger or similar situation as soon as possible *by people who are close to them* if there's a tiny chance that official authorities can't make in time.

App adds the **user's response to the request** which could make the rescuer(s) prepare for what's needed.

App is designed in a way that **shows the closest stranded peoples' request on the top** and the others' followed by it.
